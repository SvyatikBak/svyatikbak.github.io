SvyatikBak's small Minecraft mods.

There are may be some undocumented changes, because I don't log every change I make.
The only way for you to now, is to decompile Minecraft with mod and compare every file
with vanilla decompiled game or make a patch with MCP.

The only footage of the mods is my channel https://youtube.com/channel/UC5YP-naHrxeWBzVBiVt1rIg

Some mods can be considered texture/resource packs.

None of these mods use any mod loader, and they directly modify Minecraft classes.
